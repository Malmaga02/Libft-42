## LIBFT PROJECT
#### ABOUT LIBFT PROJECT
The Libft project consists in creating your own library in c. During this project I had to recreate all the basic functions
we use on a daily basis, from strlen to atoi to split. All along my journey in 42 Florence, I carried my Libft in every
new assignment, implementing it and updating it always to the "new version".
This repository shows only the mandatory work needed for the assignment.
###### ABOUT 42 FLORENCE
This is the first project I worked on while attending at 42 Florence, an innovating programming school.
The course is mainly in C, but you get to explore C++, HTML, JavaScript and a little bit of Python, thanks to
the workshops and events that the school provides.
